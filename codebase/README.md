# Science Fair Codebase
Here's all of the robot code for LawnAI! Here's how it's organized:

- `api`: API to allow for quick and easy code creation for robot
- `examples`: Example programs to test out individual APIs and API combinations
- `start`: Gets GPSD port ready, and starts up `main.py`
- `main.py`: Run on robot startup; plays startup chime and allows path creation & weeding program launch
- `main_4corners.py`: Weeding program
- `main_addpoints.py`: Path creation program
- `quickcut.py`: Test cut program
